# LoungeLobby

This is the github repo for the front end of the LoungeLobby web application. This will be used as a basis for 
all things development in relation to the webapp. Furthermore, this provides a place for the users of 
LoungeLobby to post issues and feature requests that they want to see in LoungeLobby.

# Why?
Since I started LoungeLobby a little over 5 years ago, I dreamed of making it a social place in which people 
could watch TV shows with their friends. The 5 years has been a little rocky, but I've made some major success 
with this website. Starting in 2018, I felt as though this platform could be more than what it was, and I set 
out the redesign (yes, for the 6th time, sadly.)

This redesign was meant to provide me with a basis of building a new technology stack. This would create ways 
for me to integrate in with LoungeLobby's various social profiles, to automate and extend posting on the social 
media, which could attract new visitors to LoungeLobby and promote a more social aspect.

# How can I help?
Through using LoungeLobby, whenever you experience a bug come here and report it! This allows me an easier way 
of finding issues in LoungeLobby and providing a quicker standpoint for me to fix it, and improve LoungeLobby.

Think a feature is missing from LoungeLobby? Again suggest it here, and it'll most likely be added onto the 
roadmap for LoungeLobby, for it to one day soon be developed.

My ultimate goal for this repo, is to start accepting pull requests from other users, to make LoungeLobby a 
truely open-source platform for everyone to enjoy their favourite TV shows.
Once, I feel a community has been built around the frontend of LoungeLobby, I'll make the API and other backend 
technologies Open Source to allow even further development from the community. 

## Thank you all, for the past 5 years of support.
